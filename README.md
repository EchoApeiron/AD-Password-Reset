# AD-Password-Reset
This is a basic script to just do an AD Password reset. It runs based on the credentials of the user. There is currently no way to supply another set of crednetials.

The intended way to execute is to right click and run the script file with Powershell as it will **close the console window**. 

Scripts main intention is to make it easier to reset passwords then remembering command. As well as showcase WPF in action with Powershell, and get better with error handling in Powershell.
